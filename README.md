BLR Analytics Rails Sessions
============================

This project will be built based on the Rails sessions happening in the BLR Analytics Team. For each session the instructor will choose a gem or set of gems and explain it to the team, make the necessary updates to the project and push the changes.

NOTE:<br>
After each session create your notes in "session_notes" directory and link your notes from Readme.md<br>
